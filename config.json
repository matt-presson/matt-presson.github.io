        "shortDesc": "Trainyard is an educational puzzle game for elementary and middle school students in which players edit and connect coding blocks to program instructions for train movements. It was developed as a capstone project for NC State Computer Science in collaboration with Katabasis and my teammates Alex Sawdy, Jace Glover, Samantha Collins, and Jackson Westbrook.",

            "value": "This game was made for my senior design project with NC State Computer Science, and as such we treated it like a contract-based project. Each group had an industry sponsor to work for, and my group worked with Katabasis, a 501(c)(3) organization in the Triangle that creates educational computer science games. Following a Scrum methodology, my team and I conducted 2-3 week sprints to create a paper prototype, create a Unity protoype, build levels and UI, and finally expand and polish. I worked as our lead of level design and quality assurance, creating design templates, blueprints, and level builds towards the beginning, and conducting playtests and acceptance tests towards the end. My main takeaway from this project was a wholesale software engineering project experience, from identifying requirements and constraints to creating multi-level design graphics to writing unit tests, all within the context of game design and development. While I learned a lot about the Unity engine and game engineering practices, I learned more about how to formalize development, set goals, and communicate responsibilities with teammates."
